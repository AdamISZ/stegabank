Messaging Protocol for the ssl log escrow server running rabbitMQ:

1. All messages are passed to other agents depending on the 'recipientID'
   specified in the call to 'sendMessages' in MessageWrapper.py

2. Messages to escrow only must have recipient ID: "escrow"

3. Messages to both must have "counterpartyID.escrow" 

4. Messages to counterparty only must have "counterpartyID"

5. Each message in the dict messages is of form {'topic':'message'} (stored in a string as topic|message)

6. The 'topic' field will contain <the ID of the transaction>.<the ID of the sender>

6a. In case no transaction is specified in the message, the transaction ID can be replaced by '0' in (6).

7. The 'message' will be a string of text which will be interpreted by the other agent.

8. The 'message' will have a format MSGTYPE:data,data,data;signature
(8a. In case of messages sent by escrow, no signature is appended.)

9. If the message is not one of [TRANSACTION_SYNC_REQUEST,TRANSACTION_SYNC_RESPONSE,TRANSACTION_SYNC_COMPLETE], then the first data item in (8) MUST be a new transaction state (in case of message TO escrow, this is a request which may or may not be agreed to; in case of message FROM escrow, this is a confirmation/statement of fact).
