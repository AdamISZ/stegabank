Here is how you setup a stunnel-wrapped ssh tunnel.
(Assuming there is a remote server running sshd) 

On buyer's machine:
Firefox add a HTTP/HTTPS proxy localhost:33308
compile and launch "stunnel buyer.conf"
ssh user@remoteserver -L 33309:localhost:10407 (10407 arbitrary port on the server)

On seller/gateway's machine:
compile and launch "stunnel seller.conf"
ssh user2@remoteserver -R 10407:localhost:33310
launch squid (it listens on port 3128 by default)

P.S.
change cert= path in buyer/seller.conf
use stunnel.pem only for testing. Generate your own pem for safe measure.
